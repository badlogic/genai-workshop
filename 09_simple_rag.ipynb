If you have set the presetting for the installation directory, it is the directory `C:/WinCC_OA_Proj/GettingStarted_3.19/data/GS_copy_to_myGettingStarted`.\\n\\n1. **Copy** the content of the directory to your project directory (e.g. to\\n   ```\\n   C:/WinCC_OA_Proj/myGettingStarted or <proj_path>/myGettingStarted\\n   ```\\n   ) and confirm the dialog whether the files in the sub directories (see also figure [add the simulation](GettingStarted-50.html#GettingStarted-50___Ref79209880)) should be overwritten.\\n\\n2. Click on the ![](image051.gif) symbol and open the **System Management Panel** of the graphic editor and switch to the **database** tab.\\n\\n3. Click on the ![](image208.gif) button \\\"ASCII Manager\\\".\\n\\n4. In the dialog opened, select the `GS_chapter_6_dps.txt` file from the directory `.../dplist/` of the project path with the file selector ![](image209.gif).\\n\\n5. **Select the option**Import**.**\\n\\n6. Activate the check box \\\"**Automatically update existing DP types**\\\".\\n\\n7. Activate the check box \\\"**Load Data with Alarm Handling**\\\".\\n\\n8. Initiate the import process through **Start**.\\n\\n9. After a successful import, close the ASCII manager panel.\\n\\nFigure 1. Import the Existing State (data point types) with the ASCII Manager Panel\\n\\n![](add_prepared_ACSII_GS_chapter_6.png)\\n\",\n          \"# Handling of Modules, Panels and Child Panels\\n\\nYou can find the functions for **handling of all visible windows** (modules, panels, child panels) in the online help under types of functions > [panel.ctl](../Control_Grundlagen/Control_Grundlagen-35.html). The most essential are:\\n\\n* [RootPanelOnModule()](../ControlE_R/RootPanelOnModule.html \\\"Opens a panel in a particular module.\\\")\\n* [RootPanelOn()](../ControlE_R/RootPanelOn.html \\\"Opens a new panel in the current module.\\\")\\n* [ChildPanelOn()](../ControlA_D/ChildPanelOn.html \\\"Opens a child panel.\\\")\\n* [ChildPanelOnCentral()](../ControlA_D/ChildPanelOnCentral.html \\\"Opens a child panel centered in the calling parent panel.\\\")\\n* [ChildPanelOnModal()](../ControlA_D/ChildPanelOnModal.html \\\"Opens a modal child panel at the position x, y.\\\")\\n* [ChildPanelOnReturn()](../ControlA_D/ChildPanelOnReturn.html \\\"Opens a child panel with return values.\\\")\\n\",\n          \"# Dynamism of Graphic Elements\\n\\nIn the previous chapter, only [ready standard symbols](GettingStarted-44.html) were used for the display and input of process information. In the following you will **create dynamic displays yourself** and in addition create **own recyclable** symbols.\\n\\nThe first task will be to create the **display of the pump P1**. The result of this part of the task will look as follows:\\n\\nFigure 1. Pump P1 in the Graphic Editor (left) and later at runtime (right)\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-88.png) ![](GettingStarted-89.png)\\n\\n![](../Symbole/example.gif)EXAMPLE\\n\\nTo create the first own device, proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Create **a new panel** and save it under the name myProcess.pnl.\\n\\n2. Select the **width (size X) 994** and **the height (size Y) 514 pixels** in the properties window of the panel\\n\\n3. Specify the grid through the menu **View > Grid/Snap settings** with 8 x 8 pixels.\\n\\n4. Draw a **circle** of 64 pixels and hold the \\\\[Shift] key (you can see the correct size 64x64 in the status bar down right).\\n\\n5. Select white as **fill color** (background color) and black as **border color** (foreground color).\\n\\n6. Specify the **line width** with 2 using the **Border** attribute.\\n\\n7. Draw a**polygon with 3 corners** (equal-sided triangle with the pike to the right) above the circle and set the size in the Property Editor to 49x49 (51x51 pixels in the status bar). Select the fill color \\\"**Transparent**\\\" (radio box in the color selector) and the border color black. The line width should also be 2.\\n\\n8. Hold the Ctrl key pressed and select the triangle and then the circle with the left mouse key. Place the triangle within the circle by a click on the ![](GettingStarted-80.png) button and then on the ![](GettingStarted-81.png) button from the Layout Tools bar.\\n\\nThe **fill color** of the pump symbol should give information about the **operating state** of the pump - if the rotation speed of the pump is bigger than 0, the pump symbol shall be green, otherwise white. Configure this using the wizards.\\n\\n1. Select the circle of the pump symbol.\\n\\n2. In the properties sheet of the created circle (Ellipse1), select the **standard** tab.\\n\\n3. Since the graphic property \\\"**background color**\\\" and the actual value of the rotation speed should be connected, this has to be specified **already at the initialization**.\\n\\n4. Click on the wizard button of the \\\"Initialize\\\" event.\\n\\n5. In the now opened wizards, activate the check box \\\"Change color\\\".\\n\\n6. Select the entries **\\\"**Background color **\\\"** and **\\\"**Value**-**dependent**\\\"** in the next dialog and click on **Next >**.\\n\\n7. Enter \\\"P1.state.speed\\\" for the data point element or select the corresponding entry through the data point selector ![](image269.jpg).\\n\\n8. Select the relational **operator** \\\"equal to\\\" on the first row of the condition chain and the value 0 (or empty field) for the comparative value (the background color should visualize the OFF state only if the rotation speed is null).\\n\\n9. Select the color name \\\"STD\\\\_device\\\\_off\\\" using the color selector (or another color for the OFF state).\\n\\n10. On the second row of the condition chain, select the operator \\\"otherwise\\\".\\n\\n11. Select the second color, for example, \\\"STD\\\\_device\\\\_on\\\" and click on **Finish.**\\n\\nFigure 2. Configuration of a color change depending on a data point element (Wizards)\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-83.png)\\n\\nAdditionally, the **actual value of the rotation speed** should be shown under the pump symbol using **a horizontal bar**. Furthermore, the current **operating state \\\"Manual mode\\\"** should be displayed through the visibility of a **hand symbol**.\\n\\n1. **Draw** a **rectangle** (64x8 pixels) under the pump symbol.\\n\\n2. Enter a bright **background color** for the rectangle, for example, white.\\n\\n3. Copy this rectangle (\\\\[Strg]+\\\\[C] \\u00f0 \\\\[Strg]+\\\\[V]) and place it directly above the first rectangle.\\n\\n4. Enter a **background color** for the second rectangle, for example, \\\"STD\\\\_device\\\\_on\\\".\\n\\n5. Select the upper (green) rectangle and click in the property sheet on the symbol \\\"**Open Property Wizard**\\\" next to the Initialize event to open the wizard.\\n\\n6. Select \\\"**Scale Object**\\\" in the wizards.\\n\\n7. For the scaling in x direction (horizontal) enter the data point element P1.state.speed of data point type GS\\\\_PUMP or select the element with the data point selector (hint: you can also use a filter for the data point selector in order to select the elements faster).\\n\\n8. Select the \\\"WinCC OA Value range\\\" as basis for the scaling. This is meaningful since the range boundaries for this data point element [were already set correctly](GettingStarted-32.html) (see figure in the chapter [Functionality of the Device Oriented Data Object - Configs](GettingStarted-32.html)).\\n\\n9. Click **Finish**.\\n\\nThe manual mode will be displayed by **dynamic change of the visibility** of an external created image file.\\n\\n1. Draw a **rectangle** top right a pump symbol with approximately 32x32 pixels (see figure in the beginning of this page).\\n\\n2. Select the option \\\"Pattern\\\" for the entry \\\"Filling\\\" in the property sheet of the rectangle and select the [Installation directory](GettingStarted-22.html) in the file selection window using the combo box at the bottom of the window. If you have installed WinCC OA in the suggested directory, the selection will be C:/Siemens/Automation/WinCC\\\\_OA/\\\\<version>/pictures/.\\n\\n3. Select all files (\\\\*.\\\\*) in the file selection dialog in the \\\"**File type**\\\" field.\\n\\n4. Navigate to the file /Indicators/manual\\\\_mode\\\\_hand\\\\_yellow\\\\.wmf and click **Open** - the selected graphic will be added as rectangle.\\n\\n5. Open the color selector for the foreground color (line color) by clicking next to the entry \\\"**Foreground color**\\\".\\n\\n6. Activate in the color selector the radio box \\\"**transparent**\\\" on top left and confirm with **OK** - the border of the rectangle will be removed.\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-85.png)\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-86.png)\\n\\n1. Select the rectangle with the **yellow****hand symbol**.\\n\\n2. Click on the \\\"**Open attribute wizards**\\\" button next to **Initialize** on the \\\"**Standard**\\\" tab of the property sheet in order to open the wizards for the simple configuration.\\n\\n3. Activate the check mark for **\\\"Change Visibility\\\"**.\\n\\n4. Enter P1.state.manual for the data point.\\n\\n5. Confirm the **presetting** (object visible when the value is TRUE) with **complete**.\\n\\nYou can now test the result of your configuration using the [preview of the graphic editor](GettingStarted-45.html). Since no elements for changing values were added to the panel, you have to change the values in PARA. A possibility for testing own graphic objects will be introduced in the next chapter ([Dialogs for the Graphic Object: Test panel](GettingStarted-47.html)).\\n\\nFurthermore, the **alarm state should also be visualized**. There are several ways to do this. One way is to use the display via a separate symbol above the pump symbol. As long as there is no alarm that should be acknowledged or that is pending, the new object will be displayed greyed out. In case of an active alarm, the graphic object will display the **state color of the current alarm state**.\\n\\n1. Draw a frame of type \\\"**Text**\\\" in the pump symbol on top left (see figure at the beginning of this chapter) - this is the \\\"A\\\" symbol in the toolbar.\\n\\n2. Select a darker shade of grey for the **foreground** color (text color) and a little bit brighter shade of grey for the **background** color .\\n\\n3. Enter an **exclamation mark \\\"!\\\"** for the text and select the option **Text format> Center** in the property sheet.\\n\\n4. **Select the font \\\"**Arial**\\\", the font size**14pt**and the font style \\\"**Bold**\\\".**\\n\\n5. Click on the wizard button of Event \\\"initialize\\\" in order to open the wizard for the simple configuration.\\n\\n6. Select the entry \\\"**Change color**\\\".\\n\\n7. Activate the check box **\\\"Background color (filling, Text background)\\\"** in the dialog and make sure that the radio box \\\"**Alert handling**\\\" in the frame \\\"**Background**\\\" is selected. Click on **Next**.\\n\\n8. Enter **`P1.alarm`** for the data point element and click on **Finish**.\\n\\nThe completed graphic for the pump P1 should look like shown in the first figure on this page. Confirm this by checking it in the graphic editor as well as in the preview.\\n\\n![](image288.gif)\\n\\nThe definition of dynamic properties for graphic objects using the wizard, is called \\\"**Simple Configuration**\\\" in WinCC OA. For more information see [Simple Configuration, basics](../Einfache_Parametrierung/Einfache_Parametrierung1.html).\\n\\nWhen you configure using the wizard, all configurations for defining the dynamic behavior of a graphic object, will be saved as a CONTROL script in the background. The wizard itself creates the scripts. If you click in the property sheet on the symbol \\\"**Open Script Editor** (Symbol with code lines)\\\" instead of \\\"**Open Property Wizard**\\\", the script editor will be opened. You can view and also edit the script. The script language provides a much bigger functional range as that of the wizards. For more information, see [Scripting in the Graphic](GettingStarted-66.html).\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 661,\n        \"min\": 79,\n        \"max\": 3803,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 54,\n        \"samples\": [\n          418,\n          229,\n          2094\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Alternatively, you can open the console through the context menu (\\\\[right mouse click] on the project row) and start the project immediately.\\n\\nFigure 1. Start a project using the context menu of the project administration\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-07.png)\\n\\nYou can also open a project that should be started individually directly in the console without using the project administration (Combo box \\\"**Project**\\\").\\n\\nFigure 2. Console as control center of a project - manager list with operating status\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-06.png)\\n\\nThe console is the **control center of a project**. Here you specify **which managers** must run for the plant operation. Additionally, you define their **start order** and the necessary measures for the **process monitoring**.\\n\\nThe selected project is **started** by clicking the green **traffic light symbol**![](image118.gif) . The **sequential** proceeding start process can be observed in the console.\\n\\nA project can also be stopped via the console by clicking the **red traffic light** symbol. The project is stopped in the inverse order as it was started. The colored first row always shows the **current operating statuses** of the current manager.\\n\\nAlternatively to the complete start of a project, **each of the listed managers could also be started or stopped individually**. Use the context menu \\\\[right mouse click] in the manager list or one of the vertical arranged buttons on the right. Consider that some managers can only be started manually if data and event managers are already running. See the chapter [Console panel](../Pmon_Consolepanel/Pmon_Consolepanel-11.html) for detailed information on the individual buttons.\\n\\nThe console works independent from the **actual WinCC OA system**. Even if the console is closed, the managers will be running. As soon as the console is opened again, it shows the operating states of the managers again. In normal operation it may remain closed like the project administration.\\n\\nThe following part of the console as well as the sections [directory structure](GettingStarted-22.html) to [copy and backup project](GettingStarted-24.html) can be considered as **detailed information**. They are not mandatory at the start but help you to understand WinCC OA better.\\n\\nThe console does not communicate with different managers. The PMON, a monitoring process, runs in the background. It starts and stops managers and monitors constantly their function integrity. Furthermore, the PMON can run as service so that WinCC OA can also be used without a login user.\\n\\nThe console represents the user interface of the PMON. Without having an effect on the functionality, it shows the information of the background process and passes the user inputs to the process. The PMON possesses comprehensive interfaces so that it can be included in the existing IT infrastructure (SNMP, HTTP). For further information see chapter [Process monitor, basics](../Pmon_Consolepanel/Pmon_Consolepanel-01.html).\\n\",\n          \"# Settings for a Data Point Element\\n\\nThe new data point P2 is ready for use in our application. However, it is often desirable to make some further settings for the elements. For example, every element can carry the following additional information:\\n\\n* **Description**\\n\\n* **Alias address** (second internal notation system in addition to the data point description)\\n\\n* **Number format** (number of digits before/after the decimal point)\\n\\n* **Unit**\\n\\n**Figure: Enter the Description Text, Number Format and Unit for the Data point Element (config: \\\\_common)**\\n\\nThe settings can be displayed by a \\\\[leftMouseClick] on the \\\"\\\\_common\\\" sub element (config) for each data point element.\\n\\nEnter the settings for the data point P2 as shown in the figure above.\\n\\nIn a multilingual project you can enter the description multilingual. For more information on multilingual projects, see [Multilingual Projects, Basics](../Mehrsprachigkeit/Mehrsprachigkeit.html).\\n\",\n          \"scripts for the simulation run in a single CONTROL manager. You can define what scripts should be run in a CONTROL manager as call parameters in the console - in the available project through script lists (-f sim.lst) - see also [figure](GettingStarted-62.html#GettingStarted-62___Ref79212257) on the page \\\"Creating the simulation\\\". ## Notes and Restrictions * The file extension for a script does not have to be specified.

Alternatively, you can open the console through the context menu (\\\\[right mouse click] on the project row) and start the project immediately.\\n\\nFigure 1. Start a project using the context menu of the project administration\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-07.png)\\n\\nYou can also open a project that should be started individually directly in the console without using the project administration (Combo box \\\"**Project**\\\").\\n\\nFigure 2. Console as control center of a project - manager list with operating status\\n\\n![](GettingStarted-06.png)\\n\\nThe console is the **control center of a project**. Here you specify **which managers** must run for the plant operation. Additionally, you define their **start order** and the necessary measures for the **process monitoring**.\\n\\nThe selected project is **started** by clicking the green **traffic light symbol**![](image118.gif) . The **sequential** proceeding start process can be observed in the console.\\n\\nA project can also be stopped via the console by clicking the **red traffic light** symbol. The project is stopped in the inverse order as it was started. The colored first row always shows the **current operating statuses** of the current manager.\\n\\nAlternatively to the complete start of a project, **each of the listed managers could also be started or stopped individually**. Use the context menu \\\\[right mouse click] in the manager list or one of the vertical arranged buttons on the right. Consider that some managers can only be started manually if data and event managers are already running. See the chapter [Console panel](../Pmon_Consolepanel/Pmon_Consolepanel-11.html) for detailed information on the individual buttons.\\n\\nThe console works independent from the **actual WinCC OA system**. Even if the console is closed, the managers will be running. As soon as the console is opened again, it shows the operating states of the managers again. In normal operation it may remain closed like the project administration.\\n\\nThe following part of the console as well as the sections [directory structure](GettingStarted-22.html) to [copy and backup project](GettingStarted-24.html) can be considered as **detailed information**. They are not mandatory at the start but help you to understand WinCC OA better.\\n\\nThe console does not communicate with different managers. The PMON, a monitoring process, runs in the background. It starts and stops managers and monitors constantly their function integrity. Furthermore, the PMON can run as service so that WinCC OA can also be used without a login user.\\n\\nThe console represents the user interface of the PMON. Without having an effect on the functionality, it shows the information of the background process and passes the user inputs to the process. The PMON possesses comprehensive interfaces so that it can be included in the existing IT infrastructure (SNMP, HTTP). For further information see chapter [Process monitor, basics](../Pmon_Consolepanel/Pmon_Consolepanel-01.html).\\n\",\n          \"# Settings for a Data Point Element\\n\\nThe new data point P2 is ready for use in our application. However, it is often desirable to make some further settings for the elements. For example, every element can carry the following additional information:\\n\\n* **Description**\\n\\n* **Alias address** (second internal notation system in addition to the data point description)\\n\\n* **Number format** (number of digits before/after the decimal point)\\n\\n* **Unit**\\n\\n**Figure: Enter the Description Text, Number Format and Unit for the Data point Element (config: \\\\_common)**\\n\\nThe settings can be displayed by a \\\\[leftMouseClick] on the \\\"\\\\_common\\\" sub element (config) for each data point element.\\n\\nEnter the settings for the data point P2 as shown in the figure above.\\n\\nIn a multilingual project you can enter the description multilingual. For more information on multilingual projects, see [Multilingual Projects, Basics](../Mehrsprachigkeit/Mehrsprachigkeit.html).\\n\",\n          \"scripts for the simulation run in a single CONTROL manager. You can define what scripts should be run in a CONTROL manager as call parameters in the console - in the available project through script lists (-f sim.lst) - see also [figure](GettingStarted-62.html#GettingStarted-62___Ref79212257) on the page \\\"Creating the simulation\\\". ## Notes and Restrictions * The file extension for a script does not have to be specified.

The hardware requirements strongly depend on the size of the project and the dynamic of the process factors. Use quality hardware with corresponding functionalities such as redundant power supplies or RAID hard disks. WinCC OA supports dual and multi processor operation and benefits from it. As in case of RAM, CPU and HDD: the more the better.\\n\\nIf you need a tutorial that shows how to check this system data, see section [determine system data](GettingStarted-83.html).\\n\\nIn case of modern Windows models, the configuration and activation of the **TCP/IP network protocol** is already completed with the installation of the operating system. If this option is not available on your computer, you have to activate it manually (see also [Installation - activate TCP/IP network](GettingStarted-84.html).\\n\",\n          \"# Architecture\\n\\nWinCC OA is a **modularly built system.** The required functionalities are handled by **specific****units** that were created for different tasks. In WinCC OA these units are called **managers** - the managers are own software processes.\\n\\nFigure 1. A WinCC OA system is composed of function-specific units, managers\\n\\n![](manager_concept.png)\\n\\nIn the following, the most important managers of the figure above are briefly described. Thereby, it is merely **a simple configuration** and can be much more comprehensive in practice. In fact, there are a number of managers that are not dealt with in detail here.\\n\\n## ****Process interface****\\n\\nThe **process interface modules**, which are called **drivers****(D)** in WinCC OA, form the lowest level in a WinCC OA system. The drivers are special programs that handle the communication with the **control and field level**. Since there are numerous different communication forms with **PLCs** or remote control nodes, there are **several different****drivers** available.\\n\\nTherefore, the used **PLC** or the associated communication bus defines which WinCC OA driver should be used. To put it simply, the driver is a module that converts a certain protocol into the internal communication form of WinCC OA. The driver reads current states, measured values or counter values from the field and passes commands and set values to the subordinate controls (= the word \\\"control\\\" is used in this tutorial for all possible equipment of the basic automation (PLC, DDC, telecontrol system,...)\\n\\n## **Process image, history**\\n\\nThe **central processing center** in WinCC OA is called Event Manager (EV). This unit always keeps a current **image of all process variables** in the memory. Each other function unit (manager) that wants to access data, receives the data from the process image of the event manager and does not have to communicate directly with a control. A command from an operator station is only set as a value change in the process image of the Event manager at first. The forwarding to the appropriate target device (for example PLC) will be executed by the responsible manager automatically.\\n\\nThe Event manager is a kind of **central data distributor**, the communication center for WinCC OA. Furthermore, this manager also executes the **alert handling** and is able to execute different **calculating functions** stand-alone.\\n\\nThe data manager supports the Event manager. The Data manager is the link to a database. The Data manager handles the **configuration data of an application** that is saved in the database. Furthermore, the **historical data - value changes** and **alerts** are saved in a database. If you would like to query historic data later, the query is also executed by the Data manager and not the database itself.\\n\\nThe concept for archiving process data handles the saving and readout of information that occurs during process control or visualization. This involves values and messages that are generated by value changes. The process data is saved in Value Archives (VA). Each archive is managed by a separate archiving process. Each archive consists of a series of chronologically ordered archive files.\\n\\n## ****Processing, Control****\\n\\nIn WinCC OA there are numerous possibilities to implement own **algorithms** and **processing**. The internal language control (CTRL) and the common programming interface API (Application Programming Interface) are the most important.\\n\\nControl is a powerful scripting language. The code is processed interpretatively so compiling (= conversion process which interprets a source code into executable machine code for the processor) is required. The syntax corresponds to the ANSI-C (= \\\"C\\\"... international standardized and exquisitely widespread, higher-level programming language.) with some simplifying modifications. It is an advanced **procedural high level language** with multithreading (parallel processing of single programs, the processing control is executed by the system itself). The language provides a widespread function library for tasks of control and visualization technics. Control can be used as**a stand-alone process**(CONTROL manager) for animation and**user interface design**(UI manager) or for standardized,**data object based processing** (Event manager).\\n\\nThe **API** (WinCC OA API) presents the most powerful form of function extensions. It is a C++ class library and allows the software developer to implement individual functions as an independent additional manager (prognosis system, simulation, planning tools, proprietary databases), ....\\n\\n## ****Present, handle****\\n\\nThe User Interface Manager (UI) is the interface to the **user**. Thereby, there is the **graphics editor** (GEDI), a **database editor** (PARA) or the general **user interface** of the application (Module VISION). In the user interface, values are shown, commands are executed or alarms are tracked . Furthermore, **trends** or **reports** are normally part of the UI. In WinCC OA the user interaction is technically completely separated from the background processing. It is merely a view of the data of the current process image or the history.\\n\",\n          \"# WinCC OA Getting Started - Tutorial\\n\\nThis GettingStarted tutorial is addressed to automation technicians, project engineers and developers who perform tasks in the fields of process visualization, control technology and the Collaborative Manufacturing Management (CMM).\\n\\nThrough its scalable and modular system concept, WinCC OA provides a powerful and future-proof basis for each form of control center application. The consistently implemented client-server architecture allows multi-user access with simultaneous multilingualism. The possible configurations range from autonomous single systems with minimum configuration to multi-computer applications for load sharing as well as multi-server clusters (distributed systems). Hot-standby redundancy of the servers as well as the full network redundancy provide high availability.\\n\\nThis tutorial describes the basics of technics and use of the automation software WinCC OA on the basis of practical examples. The fields \\\"structured data model\\\" and \\\"Object orientation\\\" build the main focus. The purpose is to get to know WinCC OA quickly and independently though it's not possible to go into details of the whole range of functionality. In addition we recommend to participate in a professional training.\\n\\nThe content of this tutorial was up to date at the time of creation.

The user uses the **mouse**, the **keyboard** and other input devices **interactively** with an immediately displayed response on the screen. **Alerting** in case of critical conditions or exceeding of a threshold as well as **historical archiving** of data for later presentation and interpretation also belongs to the core functions.\\n\\nSuch systems are mostly called **control systems**, **visualization systems** or according to the Anglo-american acronym as **SCADA** or HMI. SCADA is the abbreviation for ***Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition which describes the manner of the programm package very well. **HMI**stands for**Human Machine Interface**.***\\n\\nFigure 1.

The hardware requirements strongly depend on the size of the project and the dynamic of the process factors. Use quality hardware with corresponding functionalities such as redundant power supplies or RAID hard disks. WinCC OA supports dual and multi processor operation and benefits from it. As in case of RAM, CPU and HDD: the more the better.\\n\\nIf you need a tutorial that shows how to check this system data, see section [determine system data](GettingStarted-83.html).\\n\\nIn case of modern Windows models, the configuration and activation of the **TCP/IP network protocol** is already completed with the installation of the operating system.

Thereby, it is merely **a simple configuration** and can be much more comprehensive in practice. In fact, there are a number of managers that are not dealt with in detail here.\\n\\n## ****Process interface****\\n\\nThe **process interface modules**, which are called **drivers****(D)** in WinCC OA, form the lowest level in a WinCC OA system. The drivers are special programs that handle the communication with the **control and field level**. Since there are numerous different communication forms with **PLCs** or remote control nodes, there are **several different****drivers** available.\\n\\nTherefore, the used **PLC** or the associated communication bus defines which WinCC OA driver should be used. To put it simply, the driver is a module that converts a certain protocol into the internal communication form of WinCC OA. The driver reads current states, measured values or counter values from the field and passes commands and set values to the subordinate controls (= the word \"control\" is used in this tutorial for all possible equipment of the basic automation (PLC, DDC, telecontrol system,...)\\n\\n## **Process image, history**\\n\\nThe **central processing center** in WinCC OA is called Event Manager (EV). This unit always keeps a current **image of all process variables** in the memory. Each other function unit (manager) that wants to access data, receives the data from the process image of the event manager and does not have to communicate directly with a control. A command from an operator station is only set as a value change in the process image of the Event manager at first. The forwarding to the appropriate target device (for example PLC) will be executed by the responsible manager automatically.\\n\\nThe Event manager is a kind of **central data distributor**, the communication center for WinCC OA. Furthermore, this manager also executes the **alert handling** and is able to execute different **calculating functions** stand-alone.\\n\\nThe data manager supports the Event manager. The Data manager is the link to a database. The Data manager handles the **configuration data of an application** that is saved in the database. Furthermore, the **historical data - value changes** and **alerts** are saved in a database. If you would like to query historic data later, the query is also executed by the Data manager and not the database itself.\\n\\nThe concept for archiving process data handles the saving and readout of information that occurs during process control or visualization. This involves values and messages that are generated by value changes. The process data is saved in Value Archives (VA). Each archive is managed by a separate archiving process. Each archive consists of a series of chronologically ordered archive files.\\n\\n## ****Processing, Control****\\n\\nIn WinCC OA there are numerous possibilities to implement own **algorithms** and **processing**. The internal language control (CTRL) and the common programming interface API (Application Programming Interface) are the most important.\\n\\nControl is a powerful scripting language. The code is processed interpretatively so compiling (= conversion process which interprets a source code into executable machine code for the processor) is required. The syntax corresponds to the ANSI-C (= \"C\"... international standardized and exquisitely widespread, higher-level programming language.) with some simplifying modifications. It is an advanced **procedural high level language** with multithreading (parallel processing of single programs, the processing control is executed by the system itself). The language provides a widespread function library for tasks of control and visualization technics. Control can be used as**a stand-alone process**(CONTROL manager) for animation and**user interface design**(UI manager) or for standardized,**data object based processing** (Event manager).\\n\\nThe **API** (WinCC OA API) presents the most powerful form of function extensions. It is a C++ class library and allows the software developer to implement individual functions as an independent additional manager (prognosis system, simulation, planning tools, proprietary databases), ....\\n\\n## ****Present, handle****\\n\\nThe User Interface Manager (UI) is the interface to the **user**. Thereby, there is the **graphics editor** (GEDI), a **database editor** (PARA) or the general **user interface** of the application (Module VISION). In the user interface, values are shown, commands are executed or alarms are tracked . Furthermore, **trends** or **reports** are normally part of the UI. In WinCC OA the user interaction is technically completely separated from the background processing. It is merely a view of the data of the current process image or the history.\\n\"},\n",
