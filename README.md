# Generative AI Workshop

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for the workshop `Generative AI - A whirlwind tour` by [Mario Zechner](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames).

For **remote or in-person workshop** bookings, please reach out at contact@badlogicgames.com.

**Workshop Duration**: Minimum 4 hours, maximum 10 hours.

**Languages**: English and German (Course materials in English only).

**Content Overview**:

1. A **practical introduction to machine learning**, and **generative large language models** in particular, supplemented by interactive notebooks.
2. An **extensive Q&A session** addressing:
   - Application of these technologies within your organization.
   - Feasibility of specific use cases you have in mind.
   - Validity and effectiveness of AI-based products offered by third parties.

**Key Takeaways**:

- Fundamental insights into machine learning, focusing on generative large language models.
- Strategies for integrating machine learning models into your business processes.
- The ability to critically assess the claims made by AI solution providers.

**Pricing** is tailored to meet individual or organizational needs.
